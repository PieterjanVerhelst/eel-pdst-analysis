# Data analysis

# independent 2-group t-test

# 1. 2 independent groups
# N and SW are independent (each direction is attributed to a different animal)

# 2. Normality
qqnorm(tr_summary2$speed, pch = 1, frame = TRUE)

shapiro.test(tr_summary2$speed)
# The p-value > 0.05 implying that the distribution of the data are not significantly different from normal distribution. In other words, we can assume the normality.

# 3. Homogeneity of variances
# F-test 
# The F-test is used to assess whether the variances of two populations (A and B) are equal. The test requires normality (in case no normality, apply Fligner-Killeenâ€™s test)

var.test(speed ~ Direction, data = tr_summary2)
# When p > 0.05, there is no significant difference between the two variances.
